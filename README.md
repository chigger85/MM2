A JavaScript Web App for New Magdalen Football AFC that uses a mongodb database, node.js, express and angular. In other words
its a MEAN app.

The idea is to allow each player their own log in so that they can manage their availabilities for upcoming games and events.
The website will function as a simple database to record results and player statistics. The aim is to automate the organisation
of the club as easily as possible and then abstract to produce a template for other sports teams to use.
